I thought my website looked too impersonal with Tailwind, and that I need to use more English as my main language here, in order to make this profile more international rather than Spanish-only. I also added Language tags in my posts.

I have a long way down to the ideal website but it's a good start (I didn't like Tailwind for this, seriously).

Cheers!
